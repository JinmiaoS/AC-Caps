# AC-Caps
This is a deep learning method used for predicting the RBP binding sites on lncRNA chains.
We comprehensively evaluate AC-Caps on 31 experimental datasets of 12 lncRNA binding proteins.
The dataset download from https://github.com/NWPU-903PR/HOCNNLB.
The  AC-Caps is supported on windows operating system python 3.6 Keras 2.1.6 library and its backend is TensorFlow Sklearn.

Execute Step:
1 Configure the hyperparameters 
2 Run AC-Caps.The final evaluation metric is written to the text format (metrics_file.txt).
3 The final prediction results are stored in predict.txt.
